INCAR.ref:
The file INCAR.ref is a general VASP INCAR file that we utilized to generate the training data from the parent POSCAR structures using NVT. 
The temperature begin and end need to be modified for the specific values desired for each element (e.g. 0.25 Tm and Tm) ****Tm is the element's metling temperature ***

input.json and out.json:
The DeepMD-kit with the compatible verison of LAMMPS code, used in this work, can be found here https://github.com/deepmodeling/deepmd-kit/releases/tag/v2.1.2.  
We utilized both the CPU and GPU verisions and reccommend using the conda based install. 

The input.json file is an example the deepMD-kit fitting parameters used for each elements final iteration.  

For each randomly seeded fitting of the training data we modified  "training": { "seed": 9999999,   with discinct values. 

Additionally the paths element specific training data ("training_data": { "systems": [ XXXXXXXX ], must be replaced. These training are found in the element specific Training_Data folder as compressed file(s).

As well as element ID "type_map" [ "Al" ] with the apropiate elemental symbol (e.g., Al, Kr, Pb, etc).

lcurve.out:
lcurve.out is the example corresponding output from the training of the Element-iteration-0.pb potential ( e.g., Co-2-0.pb ) using the DeepMD-Kit.
